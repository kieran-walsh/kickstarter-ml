Machine Learning Project - Predicting the success of a Kickstarter project
Project 2 for 67-364: Data Science with Python; Worked with Dillan Gajarawala on this project

#### Summary
Developed a K-Nearest Neighbors classification model that would predict the success of a Kickstarter campaign based on its category, goal, and other characteristics
Used the Python data science tools scikit-learn and pandas to both clean and analyze data, as well as train and test the classification model
The final model was able to correctly predict project successes/failures with 89% accuracy
